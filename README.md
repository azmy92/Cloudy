map-reduce-Search-engine
========================

A simple search engine using a simple map and reduce function

Use one map-reduce:
 The input is a file for each url, that contain its content and the file name is the same as
 the url.
 
 The first map-reduce is to construct the inverted index, its input is (key: file name (url
 name), value: file content), the output of the map is (key: word, value: url name). The
 output of the reducer is (key: word, value: all urls that has this word in its content) and
 saved to inverted index file.

 Use the inverted index file to search for the words in the query and get its associated
 urls.
 
 Show the user the urls sorted based on their relevance.


the project is divided to two phases:

1- offline phase 
This phase is implemented using Hadoop.
input: urls
output: inverted index file (key: word, value: url name)


2- online phase
This phase is implemented using node.js
input: user query
output:  urls sorted based on their relevance
